# monopoly-board-game
A modified monopoly board game with object sharing

The game is a two-player turn-based game, which is played on a board-like data structure that you will create. The board consists of slots, and each slot represents a property that can be owned by any of the players. Both players start with an initial capital that is given in the beginning of the program as input. Both players start the game on the first slot of the board and move circularly on the board according to the dice result. The players play in turns. First, player 1 (given the name “Ali”) starts the game. Then player 2 (given the name “Liz”) plays. This continues in turns until the game finishes. Before playing in each turn, the player first rolls a dice to determine the amount of cells to move; the program uses a random number generator that returns an integer between (and incl.) one and six to simulate a dice. When a player lands on any slot, they might have the option to buy it, if it is not owned by the other player. If, on the other hand, a player lands on other player’s owned slot, it will have to pay a rent fee to that owning player.  If a player lands on his own slot, no action is needed. During the game, when a player lands on or passes through the starting slot, some amount of money will be deposited to his/her balance.
